    <p>Design and Layout of Bandgap Reference (BGR) Circuit                                                                                                                                                    
        ●	Designed the BGR circuit all the way down to the transistor level including the Bias generation circuit. In the top- level architecture, a current source, a rail-to-rail Cascode Amplifier and a BGR core were used.
        ●	Designed the layouts for all the top-level components and made a combined layout for the entire BGR circuit. The BGR was designed for 1.225 V. DC and AC simulations were run and observed that they met the required specs across different corners. DRC and LVS checks were performed and the stability of the circuit was verified.

        ●	Designed the high PSRR LDO using six different components: Error Amplifier, BGR, Pass Element, Resistive Feedback Network, Thermal Shutdown and Enable System
        ●	Designed the LDO for a fixed output voltage of 1.5 V for input range  of 2V to 2.6V for a temperature range -40-125C. The design was verified for FF, SS, TT corners.</p>
        <p>Design of a Audio Band VLSI op-amp using templates   </p><p>                                                                                                                                                 
        ●	Designed op-amps based on Two stage, Folded Cascode, Telescopic and rail-to-rail Folded Cascode templates. Verified the designs across various PVT corners, performed floor planning and designed layouts for each template.
        ●	Verified DC Gain, Phase Margin, Power and Unity gain Bandwidth for each template and performed DRC and LVS checks for rail-to-rail Folded Cascode.</p> 
        <p>ASIC acceleration for Graph Convolution Networks (GCN)</p><p>

        ●	Designed a 12-bit ADC using 9-RSD stages of 1.5 bit/stage followed by a 3-bit flash. Digital synchronization circuit was used to get bits from all stages at the same phase so that the digital correction logic can generate the output bits.
        ●	These bits were provided to DAC to verify digital output generated matches with input signal and SNR, ENOB were calculated in MATLAB.</p>
